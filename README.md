## About

With the growing amount of develop Visual Analytics (VA) solutions in various application scenarios, it becomes increasingly more redundant to always aim for a broad functionality for visualization, interaction, and computational analysis. The idea of this project is therefore to combine and coordinate existing VA tools, rather than developing a new “super-application”. The goal is to investigate general mechanisms for realizing a unified user interface that allows access to data and functions of independent VA tools to be used within a given workflow.
